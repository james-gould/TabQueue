# TabQueue
A chrome extension to queue tabs up!

# Local deployment

If for some reason you don't want to install it on your machine (storage won't persist between devices, and disabling developer mode will remove saved tabs too), follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment using `git clone https://github.com/james-gould/TabQueue.git`
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in a new tab
3. Tick `Developer Mode` in the top right corner
4. Click the `Load unpacked extensions` button and open the the cloned `TabQueue` repository
5. Wahey! It's launched. You can now use it.
